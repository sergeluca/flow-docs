| Storage retention |30 days |This is from the run start time. |
| Min recurrence interval |1 minute | |
| Max recurrence interval |500 days | |

## Looping and debatching limits
These are limits for a single flow run.

| Until iterations |5,000 | |
| SplitOn items |5,000 | |
| ForEach Parallelism |1 | |

## Definition limits
These are limits for a single flow.

## SharePoint limits
There are [limitations](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/connection-sharepoint-online/) on how you can use Microsoft SharePoint with Microsoft Flow and PowerApps.

## IP address configuration
The IP address from which Microsoft Flow requests are sent depends on the [region](regions-overview.md) where the [environment](environments-overview-admin.md) that contains the flow is located. We don't currently publish FQDNs available for flow scenarios.

### Logic App Service
Calls made from a flow go directly through the Azure Logic App service. Some examples of these calls include HTTP or HTTP + OpenAPI. These calls come from the following IP addresses:
